# Color-Detection-and-Servo-Actuation
This Arduino project uses a TCS3200 color sensor to detect colors (red, green, and blue) and actuates corresponding servo motors. The project involves reading color values from the sensor and adjusting the servos to point to the detected color.

## Installation
1. Connect the TCS3200 color sensor to the Arduino board.
2. Connect three servo motors to the Arduino board for red, green, and blue colors.
3. Upload the provided Arduino sketch to the Arduino board.

## Usage
1. Power on the Arduino board.
2. Place objects of different colors in front of the color sensor.
3. Observe the servo motors moving to point to the detected color.
